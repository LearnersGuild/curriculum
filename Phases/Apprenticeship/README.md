# Apprenticeship Phase ("Area 45")

## Description

The software field -- and indeed, the world at large -- owes a great deal to the open source software community. Like most developers, members of Learners Guild benefit daily from the availability of countless freely available software tools and educational resources. We are committed to contributing to these efforts and resources as committers to (and even maintainers of) open source projects.

In the Apprentieship phase, SEPs and learners will collaborate on contributions to OSS projects and possibly on live, production systems like the LOS apps (echo, idm, etc.). SEPs will select projects and work with learners to identify appropriate issues to work on, and learners will be expected to submit pull requests to project maintainers. Learners who wish to work on their own projects may choose to do so, if they follow the guidelines listed in the section below.

Apart from helping you develop stellar technical skills, this phase also offers Career Prep. Career Prep supports learners with interview readiness, job placement support and overarching career development. Learners are responsible for working to become fully employed by the end of their time at the Guild. Since each learnerâ€™s application and job search strategy may vary, learners are responsible for keeping track of their job-hunt progress.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will learn...

- How to "look under the hood" and understand how larger applications and systems work
- How to be a good contributor: understand OSS (open source software) best practices
- Adapting to the style and conventions of an existing codebase
- How to develop elegant, maintainable solutions to complex problems
- DevOps for live production deployments
- More advanced debugging and problem-solving skills
- How to collaborate on a team and use basic project-management tools
- Start Interviewing
  - Practice "live coding" algorithms.
  - Practice realtime problem solving in mock technical interviews
    - data structures and algorithms
    - systems design
  - Create and refine all job search materials
  - Develop compensation negotiation skills
- Expand Your Career Network
  - Attend career development workshops
  - Attend meetups and hackathons
  - Obtain one or more mentors
  - Find engineers who will advocate for you from the inside

## Engagement Expectations
- Daily standup at 9am.
- Weekly 1:1 checkin with an SEP.
- End of week project demo.

## Working on personal projects
- You're required to have a plan for your work at the beginning of each week. This plan should include a high level description of the work being done as well as specific criteria for successful completion.
- During your weekly 1:1 check-ins, an SEP will review your work plan with you and offer feedback/guidance as needed.
- All stories/issues for your software project must be tracked in a public project tracker (e.g. Github Projects), allowing someone to quickly understand your project's progress.
- At the end of the week, you'll be expected to demo the work you've completed in a group.
- Multi-week projects are allowed, but there must be clear progress being made every week. Your commit history _will_ be reviewed, so be prepared to share details about the code you've committed.
