# Apprenticeship Phase ("Area 45")

In the Apprentieship phase, you'll have the opportunity to self-direct your weekly project work. Some examples of the kinds of work that are acceptable are included below with some guidelines. Apart from continued support in helping you develop stellar technical skills, career prep resources are also made available to you in the Apprenticeship phase. These include (but are not limited to) interview prep support, job placement support and general career development guidance. Learners are responsible for working to become fully employed by the end of their time at the Guild. Since each learnerâ€™s application and job search strategy may vary, learners are responsible for keeping track of their job-hunt progress.

#### Internal Guild Projects

Some SEPs manage the development of live, complex systems. These include the Talent app, Echo, and other applications on the Learning Operating System (LOS) platform. You'll be welcome to join any of these development teams.

#### Open Source Software (OSS)

The software field -- and indeed, the world at large -- owes a great deal to the open source software community. Like most developers, members of Learners Guild benefit daily from the availability of countless freely available software tools and educational resources. We are committed to providing you with the support you need to make meaningful contributions to OSS projects.

#### Personal Projects

If you have an idea for an application that you're passionate about building, you're also encouraged to work on that in the Apprenticeship phase. You can work on a project solo or recruit a team of other developers and build it together. As always, every individual working on a personal project is **_required_** to produce a detailed plan of work at the beginning of the week. It will be reviewed by and SEP who will offer feedback on your work plan and check in on how your progress is going. Similarly, as in previous phases, you'll be requird to participate in demo time at the end of the week and to share what you accomplished that week with your squad.

Other Notes:

- Work plans should include a high level description of the work being done as well as specific criteria for successful completion.
- All stories/issues for your software project must be tracked in a public project tracker (e.g. Github Projects), allowing someone to quickly understand your project's progress.
- Multi-week projects are allowed, but there must be clear progress being made every week. Your commit history _will_ occasionally be reviewed, so be prepared to share details about the commits you've made to the repo.
