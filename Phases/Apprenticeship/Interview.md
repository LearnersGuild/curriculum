#### Secondary Skills

The following skills are _important_ but will not _explicitly_ be a part of the coding challenge. You will need some fluency in them in order to complete the challenge.

- Meta Learning

  - example: use MDN for syntax lookup

- Code Editor (Intermediate)

  - example: use plugins for Atom or Sublime to surface code quality issues

- UNIX Shell / Terminal

  - example: start and stop processes

- Debugging server and client applications

* Dev Ops

  * example: deploy a web app to Heroku

* Code Reviews

#### Sample challenge

A sample version of the challenge is provided for each phase interview level to help you to become familiar with the challenge format and the topics covered. It's highly recommended that you time yourself (or recruit a practice interviewer to time you) while you complete the challenge.
