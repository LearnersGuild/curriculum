# Foundation Modules

## Resources

There are a lot of different resources available to you in these modules. Experiment with the different sources until you find what fits best with your learning style. Perhaps you find you learn best from video. Or you like to learn from video, and then re-inforce by reading text. Or you tend to tune out during videos so text is better for you. See below for details of the various resources.
