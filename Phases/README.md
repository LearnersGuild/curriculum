# Phases

There are 3 sequential learning phases in our web development learning program. A phase is a subprogram dedicated to the acquisition of a specific set of skills. You'll be supported in putting those skills into practice in preparation for employment as a software developer. To begin work in any phase after the first (Foundations), you must successfully pass a phase interview which primarily consists of a live coding challenge. See more details in the [Interviews](/Interviews) section.

In the [**Foundations**](/Phases/Foundations.md) phase, you'll work through weekly modules. You'll spend the first couple of days of the week in focused study, followed by a couple of days of small project work. At the end of each day you'll reflect on your work that day, and at the end of the week you'll demo your working application.

In the [**Practice**](/Phases/Practice.md) phase, you'll be introduced to some collaborative software development tools and techniques and will be expected to apply the foundational skills you acquired in Foundations to building full-stack apps each week in teams of 2 or 3. Many of these projects will be in the form of a "snapshot goal" -- where you're provided with an existing codebase and expected to complete the implementation of one or more are of the application. Some other projects will require creating a repo from the ground up. At the end of the week you'll reflect on your work and demo the functionality you implemented.

When you reach the [**Apprenticeship**](/Phases/Apprenticeship.md) phase (commonly known as "Area 45"), you have the freedom to largely self-direct your own project work (provided that work is still primarily some form of web application development). **_You will be required to create a weekly work plan_** and to review it with an SEP during your weekly check-ins. This is the point at which you should -- if you haven't already -- begin to hone in on the specific kinds of tools, products and companies you're interested in. Your technical mentors will help you develop an individualized work/growth plan. You can choose to define & design your own projects, or you'll have the opportunity to jump onto an existing development team for a live system, such as the Guild's Learning Operating System (LOS). Making a meaningful contribution to open source software is also an acceptable use of your time in the Apprenticeship phase. Finally, you'll also have acces various job search and interview prep resources.
