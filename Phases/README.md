# Phases

### Overview

There are 3 sequential learning phases in our web development learning program. A phase is a subprogram dedicated to the acquisition of a specific set of skills. You'll be supported in putting those skills into practice in preparation for employment as a software developer. To begin work in any phase after the first (Foundations), you must successfully pass a phase interview which primarily consists of a live coding challenge. See more details in the [Interviews](/Interviews) section.

In the [**Foundations**](/Phases/Foundations.md) phase, you'll work through weekly modules. You'll spend the first couple of days of the week in focused study, followed by a couple of days of small project work. At the end of each day you'll reflect on your work that day, and at the end of the week you'll demo your working application.

In the [**Practice**](/Phases/Practice.md) phase, you'll be introduced to some collaborative software development tools and techniques and will be expected to apply the foundational skills you acquired in Foundations to building full-stack apps each week in teams of 2 or 3. Many of these projects will be in the form of a "snapshot goal" -- where you're provided with an existing codebase and expected to complete the implementation of one or more are of the application. Some other projects will require creating a repo from the ground up. At the end of the week you'll reflect on your work and demo the functionality you implemented.

When you reach the [**Apprenticeship**](/Phases/Apprenticeship.md) phase (commonly known as "Area 45"), you have the freedom to largely self-direct your own project work (provided that work is still primarily some form of web application development). **_You will be required to create a weekly work plan_** and to review it with an SEP during your weekly check-ins. This is the point at which you should -- if you haven't already -- begin to hone in on the specific kinds of tools, products and companies you're interested in. Your technical mentors will help you develop an individualized work/growth plan. You can choose to define & design your own projects, or you'll have the opportunity to jump onto an existing development team for a live system, such as the Guild's Learning Operating System (LOS). Making a meaningful contribution to open source software is also an acceptable use of your time in the Apprenticeship phase. Finally, you'll also have acces various job search and interview prep resources.

### Modules

There are two types of modules:

- _P:_ Practice Modules
- _B:_ Benchmark Modules

##### _P:_ Practice modules

Practice modules are intended to help you focus on acquiring a
specific set of skills. Each Practice module starts with a list of
specific skills and then provides resources, search terms and exercises to help
you acquire those skills.

As you go through a Practice module stay focused on learning the
specific skills listed at the top.

Practice modules aim to support you in figuring out how to research,
learn about and practice a specific set of skills. __Modules are NOT designed to
teach you the skills.__ Modules are meant to help you develop the meta-learning
skills that will enable you to use the Internet to research, learn and practice
the skills you need on your own.

An invaluable meta-skill required to become a successful software developer is
the ability to learn new skills on demand.

You won't stop learning after you leave the guild and begin your career. A daily
part of your job as a web developer will be researching and learning new skills.

So remember, while you're learning these skills you're also learning how to
teach yourself these kinds of skills in the future. Do your own google searches,
learn to how find the answers you need, get the skills you need and move on.


##### _B:_ Benchmark Modules

Benchmark Modules are intended to be used as a tool to test yourself for the
skills the previous practice modules aimed to help you learn.

Benchmark modules are larger challenges and will require you to use
[problem decomposition skills](./Problem-Decomposition/README.md). A working
solution to these modules will require solving multiple problems in a series of
steps.


##### Modules F.A.Q.

```
Q: How do I know if I have a specific skill?
A: Ask yourself first. When in doubt ask your phase instructor to confirm.
```

```
Q: If I think I already have the skills, can I skip a module?
A: Yes. But ask your instructor to confirm you have the skills.
```

```
Q: How do I know when I've completed a module?
A: You've completed a module when you have confirmed you have acquired said
skills.
```
