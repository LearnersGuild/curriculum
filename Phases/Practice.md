# Practice Phase

The Practice phase gives learners a chance to synthesize and utilize skills developed in the Foundations phase through small projects (modules) that mimic real world applications.

Each week you will choose a module to work on and, in most cases, a partner to pair with. Though pairing with others is not strictly required, it is an important way to accelerate your learning and accustom you to working on teams, and is therefore highly encouraged.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will learn‚Ä¶

- How to combine all of your front-end (HTML, CSS and Browser JavaScript) and back-end (HTTP Server, database) skills together to build full-stack applications
- Full web application architecture
- (coming soon) How to use front-end reactive frameworks to create powerful and performant user interfaces.
- How authentication works on most of the web
- How to use cookies and sessions to create continuity in your users' experience of your webpage.
- Persisting web application state in a relational (SQL) database
- How to render dynamically generated HTML
- How to use Git and GitHub on a team
- How to interpret specs, breakdown problems into manageable parts, and debug your code more effectively
- How to use _abstractions_ to make your code more maintainable and easier to reason about.
- How to use AJAX to create dynamically updating single-page apps
- How to make data available programatically by creating a RESTful API
- How to make use of modern tools to improve code quality and your coding experience
- How to understand, break down and solve the algorithm-based challenges that are typically used in interview settings.

## Engagement Expectations

Required:

- Attend daily standup at 9am.
- Have a weekly 1:1 checkin with an SEP.
- Share what you've accomplished and learned in the end-of-week project demos.

Optional:

## Recommended Roadmap üõ£

### [Week 1] Project: CRUD Mutability

#### Concepts to focus on
- Programming Naming Conventions
- Code Organization: splitting functions into their respective files, and folders
- Problem Decomposition: practice breaking each spec into smaller specs, so that it much easier to work on a smaller task at a time.
- RESTful Routes: Designing an API using RESTful routes, and using `method override` package to override the HTTP method of the request.
- Using the `fetch` API to make asynchronous HTTP requests from the browser. Make use of this [tutorial](https://davidwalsh.name/fetch).
