#### Social Emotional Intelligence for Professional Development

* It’s now widely accepted that strong self-leadership skills and high emotional intelligence contribute to high performance, exceptional teamwork and long term professional success. This workshop offers an overview of both concepts, their constituent parts, and gives participants an opportunity to identify, reflect on and discuss the skill areas in which they feel strongest and the areas in which they intend to build capacity. 

#### Self Awareness and Self Management 

* Working in a large tech company or a small startup can bring different, but equally challenging and high pressure situations. Developers who perform best are able to effectively manage their emotions, are aware of their triggers and troublesome habits, and have developed strategies for building confidence and optimism. This workshop is a deep dive into the cornerstones of emotional intelligence and gives participants a chance to begin increasing their capacity for self-management through amplified self-awareness.

#### Learning and the Brain

* “It’s not all about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out.” This is a common description of the software developer’s practice, one that unfolds in a rapidly changing landscape where ongoing learning is necessary to remain current and competitive. This workshop takes a look at what our brains need to support our learning and high performance. 

#### Deep Practice

* Forget innate talent and special gifts. There’s a growing body of research indicating that practice, specifically deep or deliberate practice, is what matters when developing talent in a craft. In this workshop we take a look at Daniel Coyle’s theory of Deep Practice and identify particular ways learners can and do build their talent as software developers. 

#### Adaptability and Achievement

* How can we cultivate strength in achievement in a professional environment where novelty and innovation are common and in a larger social context where risk and instability are signatures of the time we live in? Adaptability is a key self- management competency that’s intertwined with one’s achievement and growth potential. This workshop supports learners in understanding the mechanics of adaptability, how one presently orients towards it and what new practices may need to be established to optimize for it.

#### Social Awareness 

* Awareness of oneself as part of a larger whole, and one’s ability to build and tend to effective working relationships, especially in diverse working environments, is foundational to self-leadership. This workshop focuses on three registers of social awareness: socio-political awareness, empathy and attunement, and teamwork and collaboration. Together these three areas combine to provide us with a richer, more nuanced approach to navigating organizational cultures.
