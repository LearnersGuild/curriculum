# Learners Guild Curriculum

Welcome to the Learners Guild curriculum.

The arc of our learning program follows your growth as a web developer and consists of 3 sequential phases. The earlier phases are more highly structured and narrowly focused than the later phases. The idea is that when we’re learning something new, we need more help with figuring out _what_ we need to learn as well as help with learning it. As we become more competent, we’re increasingly prepared to work on more complex problems _and_ to self-direct our learning path. The structure and content of the sequential phases are meant to help facilitate a transition from novice web developer to a more experienced apprentice and -- perhaps more importantly -- a highly effective and learner.

To facilitate your growth as a highly effective learner our non-technical curriculum - _**Omni**_ - integrates self-leadership and social-emotional intelligence, meta-learning, and career development workshops into your experience at the Guild.
