# Omni

Omni is an integrated nontechnical curriculum designed to support you in becoming a lifelong learner, a self-leader and a competitive software developer. It has three facets: Social-Emotional Intelligence, Meta-Learning, and Career Development. Together these three areas combine with the technical learning program to provide a holistic learning experience.

Omni content is principally delivered through required workshops, small group meetings and individual coaching sessions.

#### _Why Omni?_

Omni is a prefix denoting "all". We use it here because _all of you_ is called to grow and transform when you enter this program. Although you’re here to develop the specific craft of software development, you’re also doing something much bigger than that - you're retooling for a new career in a rapidly evolving industry and that takes more than technical skill. Through engaging with Omni curriculum you have a chance to become effective at managing the personal and social complexity of entering a new profession while remaining oriented towards ongoing growth. 

Another way to think about it is to consider that the career growth you’re seeking also demands growth in other complementary areas of your life. To be successful, some of us may have to grow in our communication skills, or in our sense of self-efficacy, or in our self-awareness. 

Starting a new career is a full spectrum activity. The purpose of Omni is to provide dedicated space to help you imagine into the career you’re creating, to build and strengthen your inner resources, and to participate in a community of support with your peers.
